## Gameplay
Advice relating to Manipulator's skills and gameplay.

- Manipulator's ACE Pack (Passive), is extremely similar to Artificer's ENV Suit passive. The major difference between the two is that Manipulator's has a duration, only allowing you to fly for a short time. The duration refreshes upon touching the ground. While hovering, a speed boost is applied, making you slightly faster while using the jetpack.
- Cross is strongest when in melee range, bringing out a lot more damage than just the wave alone. It also allows faster stacking of passive effects, like Ignite and Chill. 
- Invoke's strength is it's versatility. Each ability is best suited for different situations. Ardent Ring (Fire) is best for bosses and larger targets, having the highest damage of all three abilities. Surge is best for groups of enemies, especially with the cooldown reduction from the Special bonus. Cryospire's great for holding enemies at bay, allowing you to consistently freeze enemies.
- Venting Step (Utility) is better used defensively than offensively - for dodging attacks or navigating the environment. The damaging effect can also be used to finish off enemies or applying elemental effects in an area.
- Conduit Cycle's (Special) buffs can be stored - it's good to use any extra charges you have of the ability during downtime.
